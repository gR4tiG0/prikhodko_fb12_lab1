[*] Checking the correctness of the convertion...
A == Abn: True
A16== Abn16: True
A2 == Abn2: True
[!] Convertion to common bases seeems right
[*] Checking addition...
Abn + Bbn == Bbn + Abn: True
A + B == Abn + Bbn: True
(A + B) + C == Abn + (Bbn + Cbn): True
D + A == Dbn + Abn, where D is negative number: True
[!] Addition seems right checking subtraction...
Abn - Bbn == Bbn - Abn: True
A - B == Abn - Bbn: True
(A - B) - C == Abn - (Bbn - Cbn): True
D -  A == Dbn - Abn, where D is negative number: True
[!] Subtraction seems right
[*] Checking multiplication...
Abn - Bbn == Bbn - Abn: True
A - B == Abn - Bbn: True
(A - B) - C == Abn - (Bbn - Cbn): True
Abn * 123 = Abn+Abn...+Abn times 123: True
(Abn+Bbn)*Cbn == Abn*Cbn + Bbn*Cbn: True
[!] Multiplication seems right
[*] Checking division...
Abn > Bbn: True
Abn // Bbn == A // B: True
Abn < Bbn: False
Bbn // Abn == B // A: True
Abn % Bbn == A % B: True
[!] Division seems right
[*] Checking power...
base**Bbn == base**B: True
[!] Seems right
